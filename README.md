# Server Side Calculator

## A simple, yet effective server based calculator

_Duration: 12 hours_

This project is a compilation of skills and knowledge developed over the last 8 weeks at Prime Digital Academy. Focus of this project is primarily to solidify concepts related to AJAX and Express. 


### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage
How does someone use this application? Tell a user story here.

4. Press the "equal" button
5. Sit in awe at your result
